# ProbNEL: Probabilistic NER-based Entity Linking

**ProbNEL** is a software tool designed to enhance entity linking by leveraging the probabilistic nature of Named Entity Recognition (NER) models. It leverages the confidence scores associated with different entity types to improve the accuracy of entity resolution.

**Key Features:**

* **Probabilistic Entity Linking:** Utilizes probabilities assigned to different entity types to make informed linking decisions.
* **NER Integration:** Leverages pre-trained NER models to identify entities in text.
* **Knowledge Base Integration:** Connects to knowledge bases to resolve entities to real-world entities.
* **Customizable Configuration:** Allows for fine-tuning of parameters and thresholds to optimize performance.

**How it Works:**

1. **NER:** Identifies entities in the text and assigns probabilities to different entity types.
2. **Probability-Based Filtering:** Filters entities based on their highest probability.
3. **Entity Linking:** Matches the filtered entities to entities in a knowledge base, considering their probabilities.
4. **Ranking and Selection:** Ranks potential matches based on various factors, including probabilistic scores, semantic similarity, and contextual clues.

**Potential Applications:**

* **Information Extraction:** Extracting structured information from unstructured text.
* **Knowledge Graph Construction:** Building and enriching knowledge graphs.
* **Question Answering:** Improving the accuracy of question answering systems.
* **Text Summarization:** Identifying and linking important entities for better summarization.
